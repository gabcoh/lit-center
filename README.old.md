# lit-server
A website for the Niles West highschool litcenter to view statistics (basic ones) about the tutors and students.

### Disclaimer
This is some of the first js/html code I have ever written, and as such is very bad. I have learned a huge amount since this, and maybe one day will rewrite this using some more modern frameworks and better practices (eg. backbonejs, bootstrap, jquery).
